### [Check for All or None](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/regular-expressions/check-for-all-or-none)

## PROBLEM EXPLANATION
In this challenge, you are asked to change the regex so that it defines the existence of the letter `u`, resulting in the acceptance of both American and British versions of the word favourite/favorite.

## HINTS
### Hint 1
The variable `favWord` already contains the American version - `favourite`.  Does the regular expression in `favRegex` also match the British version?
### Hint 2
Have you used the question mark, `?` symbol, if so, have you placed it in the correct position?
